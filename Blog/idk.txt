if i dont give the type names in the telescope how do i access them? by index?
and how am i supposed to use the debrujin indices?

if i encode the telescope using indices only i also need something of the sort:

(Nat::Type::(App Vect 0 1)::App Vect 0 2)
which shows App being used to reference old variables

but how do i structurally encode that App can only use indices below the length of the telescope??
hmm that seems to be the major issue here.

maybe index App with something but?... no thats weird
Maybe index App with a context itself?

i cant seem to understand the difference between the ctx and telescope maybe?
